# Fearless-NMU
This is the non-Drupal version of the Fearless NMU theme.  Development of the main Fearless NMU theme and this boilerplate version is still ongoing.  If you use these files in a production-level application, be sure to check back frequently for updates.

## How to use these files
Begin by determining if your page/pages will need left navigation.  Because all top navigation is NMU-specific navigation, most pages will need some type of left navigation.  By default the template comes with the NMU left navigation.  Other navigation snippets are included in the Navigation folder.  In the template search for *left-nav* to find the navigation to edit.

Areas of the template where user provided modifications are needed will be indicated with [[...]].

In order for the department directory search opion to function properly, PHP is required.  An alternative method to get this search working is provided in the comments of the page but it is important to read and understand the limitations of this alternative method.
